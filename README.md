This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Links

The application has been deployed on Vercel, here is the public link: [https://casper-demo-iota.vercel.app/](https://casper-demo-iota.vercel.app/)

## Approach

I elected to use a NextJS application in case we need to add server components later. In addition to Tailwind CSS, since that's what the Casper website uses.

## Features Notes

I wanted to use a third party carousel feature for the top bar but I couldn't get them to work so I chose to build one myself, it's better to minimize reliance on third party libraries as much as possible as relying on them is risky.

I've been sick, still am sick so I tried to get it done today but I couldn't if i have more time I can finish the rest of the page.
